## Phone Scripts

### Customer Phone Script (5-Minute Discovery)

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name]! This is Tyler from Garage Scholars. Thanks for reaching out. Do you have about 5 minutes? I'd love to hear about your garage and see if we can help."

**Discovery Questions:**
1. "What's your main goal - cleanout, organization, or both?"
2. "How many cars is your garage?"
3. "Any heavy items that need moving? Furniture, appliances, etc.?"
4. "Timeline - when were you hoping to get this done?"
5. "Have you thought about what to do with items you don't want? Sell, donate, trash?"

**Pricing Close:**
"Based on what you described, I'd recommend our [PACKAGE] package at $[PRICE]. That includes [BENEFITS]. Does that sound like a fit?"

**Objection Handling:**
- **"That's expensive"**: "I totally get it. Just to give you context, professional organizers charge $150-200/hour. We're offering a flat rate that works out to about $50-70/hour depending on package. Plus we handle all the heavy lifting and donation drop-off."
- **"I need to think about it"**: "Of course! What would help you make a decision? Happy to answer any questions."
- **"Can you just give me a quote?"**: "I'd love to! Could I do a quick 15-minute free assessment? I can see the space and give you an exact quote. When works - tomorrow or Friday?"

**Booking:**
"Perfect! Let me get you on the calendar. What works better - weekday or weekend?"

### Scholar Phone Interview Script (10 Minutes Max)

**Opening:**
"Hey [Name]! Tyler from Garage Scholars. Thanks for applying. How's your day going?"

**Quick Pitch:**
"So here's how it works - we help homeowners organize their garages. Jobs are posted in our app, you claim the ones you want, show up, do the work, get paid same day. Most jobs are 4-6 hours and pay $25-35/hour depending on the package."

**Qualifying Questions:**
1. "What's your schedule like? How many hours per week could you work?"
2. "Do you have a car? Most jobs are in Denver/Boulder area."
3. "Have you done any physical work before? Doesn't have to be garage work - moving, landscaping, construction?"
4. "Can you work some weekends? That's when most jobs happen."
5. "Why are you interested in this vs. other part-time jobs?"

**Red Flags to Listen For:**
- Can't work weekends = probably won't take many jobs
- No car + not in Denver metro = logistics nightmare
- Sounds entitled or high-maintenance = culture fit issue

**Green Flags:**
- Mentions needing flexible schedule
- Has worked physical jobs before
- Excited about earning potential
- Asks good questions about the work

**Closing:**
- **If YES**: "Awesome, I think you'd be a great fit. I'm going to add you to our team. You'll get a link to download the app and see available jobs. Any questions?"
- **If NO**: "Thanks for your time. We're looking for someone with a bit more availability right now, but I'll keep your info on file."

**Post-Hire:**
"One more thing - we pay $50 for every friend you refer who gets hired. So if you know anyone else who'd be interested, send them my way!"
