## PHASE 9: Founder Interview Scoring

**COMPLETED & DEPLOYED** — `https://interview-scoring-weld.vercel.app`

Source: `hiring/interview-scoring/index.html`

Founders sign in with Google (admin emails only: `tylerzsodia@gmail.com`, `zach.harmon25@gmail.com`).
The UI shows candidates in `zoom_scheduled` status with their full dossier (app scores, video scores, AI summaries, strengths, concerns).
Founders rate 6 questions (1-5), select gut check (yes/maybe/no), add notes, and submit.
Submission writes to `gs_hiringInterviewScores` → triggers `gsProcessInterviewScore` → weighted final → decision email.

Security:
- Google Sign-In with admin email whitelist (client + Firestore rules)
- `signInWithPopup` primary, `signInWithRedirect` fallback
- Vercel domain added to Firebase Auth authorized domains
- HSTS, X-Frame-Options DENY, CSP via Permissions-Policy, nosniff

**Redeploy:** `cd hiring/interview-scoring && npx vercel --prod`
