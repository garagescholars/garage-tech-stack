                        <p class="bio">Zach Harmon is a performance-minded problem solver who loves turning chaotic spaces into efficient, functional, and good-looking environments. As a physical therapist, strength coach, and entrepreneur, Zach has spent his career studying how people move, how spaces influence behavior, and how smart systems make life easier.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="bio">Garage Scholars was born from that mindset &mdash; blending organization, design, and practical utility into one streamlined service. Zach approaches every project like he approaches his clinics: with precision, clarity, and a commitment to long-term results.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="bio">When he's not transforming garages, Zach is lifting, learning, or exploring the outdoors with his family.</p>

                        <p class="bio">Dr. Tyler Sodia is a systems-obsessed builder who loves turning big, messy ideas into clean, repeatable results. As a scientist, engineer, and entrepreneur, Tyler has spent his career studying how things work&mdash;materials, machines, workflows&mdash;and how small changes in environment can completely change how people feel and perform in their space.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="bio">Tyler believes that the garage should be a personal lab. Whether he's designing a lifting-friendly layout, dialing in storage for busy families, or mapping out a full "garage ecosystem," his goal is the same&mdash;cut friction, create order, and turn the garage into an asset instead of a stressor.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="bio">When he's not rethinking garages, Tyler is lifting, learning, or sketching out the next experiment on a whiteboard, a spreadsheet, or a napkin with a cup of coffee nearby and a new idea already in motion.</p>
