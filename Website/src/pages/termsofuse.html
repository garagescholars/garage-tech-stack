            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
            <p class="intro">Welcome to Garage Scholars. These Terms of Use govern your use of our website and your engagement with our garage transformation services in the Denver Metro Area. By using our site or booking a service, you agree to these terms.</p>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>1. Our Services</h2>
                <p>Garage Scholars provides garage decluttering, organization, home gym installation, and resale concierge services. When you request a quote through our website, you are not committing to a purchase &mdash; quotes are free and come with no obligation. A service agreement begins only when you confirm a booking with our team.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>2. Quote Requests and Photos</h2>
                <p>When you submit a quote request, you agree to provide accurate information about your garage and needs. Photos you upload should be of your own property. We use these photos solely to assess the scope of work and prepare your estimate. By submitting photos, you give us permission to view and store them for this purpose.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>3. Scheduling and Cancellations</h2>
                <p>Once a service is booked, we'll confirm your appointment date and time. If you need to reschedule or cancel, please give us at least 24 hours notice so we can adjust our team's schedule. We'll always do our best to accommodate changes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>4. On-Site Work and Access</h2>
                <p>For us to do our job, you'll need to provide access to your garage on the scheduled date. Our scholars will treat your property with respect. We are not responsible for items that are already damaged, and we recommend removing any high-value or sentimental items before a major cleanout. If we find anything that looks valuable during a declutter, we'll always check with you before removing it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>5. Resale Services</h2>
                <p>As part of our resale concierge service (included in Graduate and Doctorate packages), we identify items with resale value, photograph them, list them on marketplace platforms, and manage the entire sale process. Proceeds from sold items are split 50/50 between you and Garage Scholars. You approve every listing before it goes live. Items that cannot be sold may be donated, recycled, or disposed of at our discretion. If you want to keep specific items, let us know before the cleanout begins &mdash; our team will always confirm with you before removing anything you haven't approved.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>6. Our Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>
                <p>We stand behind our work. If you're not happy with the results of your garage transformation, let us know and we'll come back to make it right &mdash; free of charge. This guarantee applies to the scope of work agreed upon in your service booking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>7. Scholar Applications</h2>
                <p>If you apply to join our team through the website, you agree that the information you provide (including your resume, if uploaded) is accurate. We review all applications and will contact qualified candidates. Submitting an application does not guarantee employment.</p>
